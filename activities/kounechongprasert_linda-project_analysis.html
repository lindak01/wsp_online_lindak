		<h1>Top Stone, Inc. Website Re-Design</h1>
		<h4>Designer: Linda Kounechongprasert</h4>
		
	<article id="intent">
	<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>	The intent of this re-design project is to completely re-organize the site structure and to create a more user friendly UI. The goal of the new website is to draw more users to the site and invite them to learn more about the business. This in turn should bring in potential business.</p>
		<p>As the site stands now, there are over 50 site pages. Many of the pages are unnecessary and contain content that could be grouped together in a more structured manner. There is no main navigation area and much of the information is cluttered and unorganized. The home page is quite confusing and does not have a call to action.</p>
		<p>Upon completion of the re-design project, this website will consist of 6 main content pages. Information will be organized and a main navigation will be created for each page. The home page will be clear about what the site is offering and a call to action will be created to invite users to inquire more about the business.</p>
